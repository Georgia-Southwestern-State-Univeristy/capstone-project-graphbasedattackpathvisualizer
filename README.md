# Graph-Based Attack Path Visualizer

This project models potential cyber attack paths within a small business IT environment using a graph-based approach. Systems and services are represented as nodes, and attacker actions are represented as weighted edges.

The project identifies likely attack paths to a high-value target and demonstrates how security mitigations affect attack difficulty by adjusting edge weights.
